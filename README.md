As flexible booking options become more prevalent, booking cancellations continue to be a big issue for the hotel industry. In this article, we will walk through the dataset we used along with the methodologies and approaches we explored to better predict hotel cancellations. Furthermore, we also tried customer segmentation, a causal model, and counterfactuals to try to understand the predicting factors better. Overall, we were able to identify key characteristics of guests that are likely to cancel their bookings and provide recommendations on what hotels should focus on when trying to reduce the number of cancellations.
